Just a game

Game Titles?: (I want it undercase)
i love you, with what little heart i have left

no one cares

Just Listen

Do it yourself

what makes a good person?

why is it okay?

is this fate?


Brainstorming Plot:
show that anyone can have depression
love everyone, no exceptions
panic attacks will distort the screen
ending shows player look into the mirror, showing Her.
Show an abusive relationship with side characters
if fate exists, does this mean i'm doomed to be a sexual abuse victim my whole life?
